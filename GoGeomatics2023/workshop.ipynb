We will cover the role of COPC and STAC in geospatial cloud systems and dive into using PDAL for creating cloud-native metadata. You'll learn practical methods for managing and processing large point cloud datasets in the cloud through demonstrations.\n"

    "A Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (COPC) is a point cloud data format engineered for efficient access and processing in cloud-based systems. Unlike traditional LiDAR formats like LAS or LAZ, COPC incorporates a hierarchical structure that enables faster and more precise spatial queries. This hierarchical metadata allows you to read specific subsets of large datasets without scanning the entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "COPC files are especially advantageous for large-scale, distributed computing scenarios where data is stored in cloud infrastructure. The format optimizes both storage and query performance, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring real-time data retrieval and analysis of massive point cloud datasets."
